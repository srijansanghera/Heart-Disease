# Heart Disease Prediction based on Age, Cholesterol, and Resting Blood Pressure

This project aims to diagnose the presence of heart disease using key health indicators: **age**, **cholesterol levels**, and **resting blood pressure**.  
It utilises data from the **Hungarian Institute of Cardiology** and applies machine learning classification techniques to predict whether a patient has heart disease.

## 📝 Project Overview

- **Research Question:**  
  *Can we accurately predict the presence of heart disease based on a patient's age, cholesterol, and resting blood pressure?*

- **Dataset Source:**  
  Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest.

- **Selected Features:**
  - `age` — Patient's age in years.
  - `chol` — Serum cholesterol (mg/dL).
  - `trestbps` — Resting blood pressure (mm Hg).
  - `num` — Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = presence, 0 = absence).

## 🛠 Methods

- Data wrangling: Handling missing values and selecting relevant variables.
- Data splitting: 75% training / 25% testing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive statistics and visualisation.
- Model building:  
  - **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** classification algorithm.
- Model evaluation: Assessing predictive performance on the test set.

## 🔧 Languages & Packages Used

- R programming language
- Packages: `tidyverse`, `tidymodels`, `kknn`, `repr`

## 📊 Results

- Built a k-nearest neighbour classification model to predict heart disease with selected features.
- Explored how age, cholesterol, and resting blood pressure relate to disease occurrence.
